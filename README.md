## Dataset
The public data set for our project is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult from UCI machine learning repository. The data for this project is from the 1994 US Census Database. 

Script to load the dataset: [R script](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_552_Income_Prediction/tree/master/scripts)  
Dataset file: [Data](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_Income_Prediction/tree/master/data)  

## Research Question
Our research proposal for this project is to determine, *what are the strongest attributes to determine a salary greater than $50,000?* This will be a predictive question.

## Plan
- load the dataset into R 
- explore the dataset
- data wrangling to clean and prepare the data according to our research project
- divide the dataset into training and testing
- use a decision tree algorithm on the training set
- apply the resulting model to the testing set

## Summary
- compare the testing statistics to the training statistics (ex. accuracy) in a table or visualization such as a tree
- return to the decision trees to determine the strongest attributes leading to a salary greater than $50,000.
